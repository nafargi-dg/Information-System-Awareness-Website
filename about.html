                        Because of the wide range of choices, there is a need for information system specialists who focus on integrating computing technologies and business processes to meet 
                        organizational needs. These specialists need to be mainly engaged in solving the problems associated with the organization issues and information systems. The department 
                        focuses on uses of the technology as a tool for processing, storing and distributing information. Graduates from the Department of Information Systems (IS) must understand
                         both technical and organizational factors. They must also be able to help organizations to use technology to achieve their goals efficiently and effectively.
                          <br><br>
                        Despite the fact that Information Systems has been given as a profession in some countries for a couple of decades, the field is too young in Ethiopia. The government 
                        of Ethiopia is now aggressively embarking on the introduction and expansion of the ICT sector as an enabling tool for the country’s development.
                            <br><br>
                        Until recently, there has been only one institution, i.e., Addis Ababa University, which offers training in IS to learners in Ethiopia. In fact, AAU launched
                         a bachelor’s program in Information Systems in 2002. Currently, following the government’s priority to the development and expansion of the ICT sector as an enabling
                          sector to national development, training in Information Systems is offered by both government and private Ethiopian institutions of higher education.

                        <br><br>
                        Information Systems professionals help organizations in identifying organizational information system requirements. Also, they are actively involved in the 
                        specification, design and development IS needs. To this end, IS professionals must have good knowledge of an organization’s principles and practices in order to
                         bridge the gap between the needs of technical and the management communities.

                <p>
                    Front-end development, often referred to as client-side development, is a crucial aspect of creating
                     a compelling and user-friendly web experience. It involves the design and implementation of the visual 
                     and interactive elements that users directly interact with on a website or web application.
                       <br> <br>
                      Front-end developers play a pivotal role in shaping the user interface and experience, using languages
                       such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is utilized to structure content, defining the underlying information 
                       hierarchy. CSS comes into play for styling layouts, ensuring a visually cohesive and aesthetically pleasing presentation.
                        Meanwhile, JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic functionalities, allowing for responsive and engaging user experiences.

                    Backend refers to the server-side of a web application, where data is processed, stored, and
                    managed. It involves server technologies, databases, and application logic that work behind 
                    the scenes to deliver data and functionality to the user's browser. Backend development is 
                    responsible for ensuring the smooth functioning of the server, handling requests, and 
                    interacting with databases to provide dynamic and responsive web experiences.

                    Database Development is a multifaceted process that entails the systematic
                     design, implementation, and management of structured data repositories. These 
                     repositories are designed to store, organize, and facilitate the efficient retrieval
                      of information. The scope of database development includes defining data structures,
                      establishing relationships between different data entities, and implementing functionalities
                       to ensure data integrity and security.
                      <br>  <br>
                    A crucial aspect of database development is the utilization of various technologies and
                     query languages. Database developers leverage these tools to create robust systems that support
                      applications, enhance decision-making processes, and enable seamless data management within organizations.
                       By employing best practices in database design and development, professionals in this field contribute 
                       significantly to the effectiveness and reliability of data-driven applications and systems.
